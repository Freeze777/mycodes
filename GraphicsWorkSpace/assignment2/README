1.Make the "assignment1" folder as the present working directory in the terminal.
2.Run "make all" command.
3.Run the executable "./assgn".

Instructions to use:
i) Select the points using the "LEFT MOUSE BUTTON" (max 50 points)
	NOTE: select points such that they are increasing in x cordinate.

ii) After selecting the points press "ENTER" to render the curves.
	The pink colored curve is Lagrange curve.
	The blue colored curve is Bezier curve.
	The black dots are the selected points.
	The yellow lines are just line strips connecting the selected points.


iii) Use "LEFT ARROW" and "RIGHT ARROW" keys to ROTATE the curves anticlockwise and clockwise resp.
	NOTE: Rotation is done w.r.t z-axis using the starting point of the curve as pivot.	

iv) Use "+/-" keys to SCALE the curves (default scaling: 2 and 0.5).

v) While viewing the curve, use the "RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON" to select two points.
   The curve will be translated in the "current" positive x direction by the distance between the two points. 

vi) Press "R" button to "restore" the transformations and to enter the "EDIT POINTS" mode. 

vii)Once inside the "EDIT POINTS" mode, one can add/delete points using the "LEFT MOUSE BUTTON" 
	Add points:The currently clicked point will be added to the set of points if they are more than 20 pixels
	 	   away from the existing point.
        Delete points: To delete an existing point, click as close( within a radius of 20 pixels) to that point.

viii) Press "ENTER" to see the new curve.

ix) Default window size is 1000 x 650. Resize to fullscreen for convenience.
